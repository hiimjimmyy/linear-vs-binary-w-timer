# linear-vs-binary-w-timer

I was able to meet the deadline for this assignment and get it to perform the task requested, but I wish I had more time to implement and test a few things about it.
Some of these things include putting a condition where if the randomly generated value that would be searched through the randomly generated array were not found, it would NULL that test and create a new one. 
I would have also liked to have this run 10-20 times, take the average of it, and display the individual trails and include the average in the bottom. I would have also liked to have created a function for the timer to make the code look cleaner. Overall I am satisfied with the results it yielded; this was a rewarding assignment once completed.
